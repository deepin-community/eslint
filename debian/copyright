    will not be considered a Derivative Work
    for the purpose of this Licence).
    For the avoidance of doubt,
    where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording,
    the synchronization of the Work

    will be considered a Derivative Work
    for the purpose of this Licence.

    indicated in the title of this Licence:

  * "Work" means
    the work protected by copyright
    which is offered under the terms of this Licence.
